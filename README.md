# vRLIQueryExtractor

This script will collect log events over a 24 hour period. It's hard coded purpose as of the first commit is for dfwpktlogs which is it's primary purpose but it can be expanded in the future for really any query.

It should solve the issue of Log Insight only being able to natively (via GUI or via API) being able to export a maximum of 20k events by collecting events over a 24 hour period in 5 minute intervals.

If you're planning to use this or any fork check out the issues tab which I'll keep up to date.
